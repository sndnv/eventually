## Features

* **Schedule Summary** - Shows you which tasks are due soon (*upcoming*) and which should have
 already been done (*overdue*).
* **Events Calendar** - Shows you what is happening on each day.
* **Notifications** - The app will let you know when it's time to start thinking about the next
 task (*context switch*) and when it's time to get it done (*alarm*).
* **Privacy & Security** - No user or device data is ever collected or sent anywhere; the app
 will never attempt to open a network connection or ask you for any additional permissions.
* **Ad-free** - The app is free; there are no ads or in-app purchases.
